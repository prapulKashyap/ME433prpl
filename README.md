Advanced Mechatronics(ME433) Assignment:

HW1: A basic program to test the circuit setup consisting of PIC32MX250F128B microcontroller(PIC) from Microchip and the accessories required. This program generates a PWM whose duty cycle is inturn controlled from an analog input from a potentiometer. The program also toggles a digital output connected to an LED, the time between toggling is used as an approximate measure to verify whether the PIC is running at 40MHz.

HW2: An EAGLE schematic for the PCB which would be identical to the circuitry used in HW1.

HW3: Complete gerber files of the PCB design run with Seedstudio CAM files. the gerber files are sent to Seedstudio and 10 PCBs are ordered.

HW4: Library to run OLED screen through I2C and print strings on to the screen by controlling which appropriate pixels to light up.

HW5: Library to connect an accelerometer using SPI, and display bars in X and Y direction of the OLED screen whose length are proportional to acceleration in x and y directions respectively.

HW6: Program to demonstrate coding by changing example files given by Microchip. There are two programs written, the first one is used to toggle the LED connected, and the second one is used to input a set of values to control the mouse pointer in the computer connected.

HW7: Program to use previous written libraries to implement a functional mouse using the tilt of the accelerometer.
